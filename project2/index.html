            <p>
                At <a href="#">Teamup Calendar</a> we've been busy introducing new features and making improvements over the past months.
                It's time for an update! Here are the highlights:

                Teamup has been built for groups from the very beginning. The needs of groups continue to be our focus of product development.
                We introduced event signup and event comments earlier. Now we have just made event fields customizable (public beta),
                so that you can not only rename the built-in fields of Who/Where/Description, but also add custom fields as needed.
                <a href="#">View an example.</a>

                <p>
                    Add comments to any event, keep them private or make them visible to all...

                Printing your calendar just got easier and better. Teamup's new PDF print function optimizes the print layout,
                improves the print quality, and gives you a ready to print PDF file. Print in full color or eco mode.
                The eco mode increases readability of printouts and reduces print cost.

                Teamup is now available in 15 languages. The recently added langauges include: Italian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Polish, and Romanian.

                You may have been sharing single events by way of exporting to your personal calendar, posting on social media, or emailing to your group.
                Since many of you use Teamup for internal planning, sometime it's desirable to restrict the sharing of calendar events.
                We've now made the <a href="#">sharing options</a> configurable so that the calendar administrator has more control over ways to share events.
            </p>

        <div class="text-content">

                No doubt that the mobile experience of Teamup Calendar is becoming ever more important. We've released several improvements for mobile users and
                continue to work on better mobile support. Use your calendar with <a href="#">mobile browser</a>, the <a href="#">iOS app</a> or the
                <a href="#">Android app</a>(make sure to update to the latest app version).
